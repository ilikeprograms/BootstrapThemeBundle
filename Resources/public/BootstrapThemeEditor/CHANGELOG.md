Changelog
=========

The Changelog will details the changes to the project.
Minor commits will probably be included, and groups of changes may be combined
into a general description. So the changelog doesnt become too large.

The intent is so that peopel can look at the changelog and roughly see whats changed,
without getting into too much detail.
